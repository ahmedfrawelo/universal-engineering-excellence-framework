# Global Security Hardening

Version: 1.1.0  
Status: Enforced  
Applies to: product UI, services, APIs, and data paths where relevant

## Purpose

Applies defense in depth across identity, authorization, validation, dependencies, secrets, errors, and operations.

## Required Practice

- Model assets, actors, trust boundaries, abuse cases, and recovery before sensitive implementation.
- Use least privilege, deny by default, secure configuration, and centralized policy enforcement.
- Block release on unresolved critical or high findings without accepted risk.

## Delivery Contract

Before editing, record the existing project evidence and the intended extension point. During implementation, keep policy in shared tokens, components, services, middleware, or data access boundaries rather than page-specific patches. At review, demonstrate behavior at relevant themes, viewport sizes, input modes, trust boundaries, and realistic load. Exceptions require an owner, rationale, risk, expiry condition, and regression test.

## Verification Evidence

- [ ] The applicable existing system was inspected before implementation.
- [ ] Automated or repeatable checks cover the primary contract.
- [ ] A realistic manual or integration scenario covers behavior tools cannot prove.
- [ ] Residual risks and non-applicable checks have concrete reasons.

## Failure Conditions

- Implementation relies on page-specific values or behavior without justification.
- Accessibility, security, or performance is asserted without evidence.
- A supported theme, viewport, input method, or failure path is visibly broken.

## Completion Rule

This module passes only when implementation evidence demonstrates the required behavior. A build alone is not evidence of visual, interaction, security, or performance correctness.
