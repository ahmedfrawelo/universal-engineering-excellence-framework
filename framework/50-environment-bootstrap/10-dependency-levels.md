# Dependency Levels

Version: 1.4.0
Status: Enforced

## Purpose

Defines Mandatory, Recommended, and Optional behavior.

## Required Practice

- Mandatory missing blocks after safe install attempt; Recommended missing warns; Optional missing continues.
- Never silently downgrade a mandatory dependency.
- Classify every dependency as Mandatory, Recommended, or Optional.
- Emit Environment Ready, Profiles Loaded, Mandatory Dependencies, Recommended Dependencies, Optional Dependencies, Missing Items, Installation Performed, and Validation Result.

## Evidence

- [ ] Current command, path, version, skill, MCP, or runtime evidence is recorded.
- [ ] Profile selection is traceable to task or repository evidence.
- [ ] READY/BLOCKED/WARN matches the dependency policy.

## Failure Conditions

- Mandatory gaps are ignored or hidden.
- The checker claims readiness without current evidence.
- A fixed universal tool list blocks unrelated work.
